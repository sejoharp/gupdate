```

### Prerequisites

* git installed
* github access token (used for pulling/cloning)

### Installation

#### use release
1. download the latest release
2. make it executable
   ```bash
   chmod +x gupdate
   ```


#### Compile from source

1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fr3dch3n/gupdate.git
   ```
2. Build the binary for your OS
   ```bash
   make build-linux-amd64
   make build-darwin-amd64
   make build-windows-amd64
   ```

## Usage

Put your configuration file in $HOME/gupdate.yaml or provide a specific path via `gupdate -c <path>`.

### Configuration

The configuration has to follow this format:
```yaml
authentication:
  token: token                              # github access token
  username: my_username                     # github_username for authentication
me:
  username: me                              # your github username (probably the same as authentication.username)
  dir: /home/user/repositories/me           # repos location
  clone_archived: false                     # should archived repos be cloned?
users:
  - username: username                      # specific user to clone
    dir: /home/user/repositories/username   # repos location
    clone_archived: false                   # should archived repos be cloned?
teams:
  - teamname: teamname                      # teamname to clone repos from
    prefix: remove_prefix                   # remove prefix from repos (e.g. team1_repo)
    dir: /home/user/repositories/teamname   # repos location
    org: organization                       # org for the team
    clone_archived: false                   # should archived repos be cloned?
```

* token: <plain text token>
* token_file: <path to a file containing the token>
* token_env_variable: <env variable containing the token>
